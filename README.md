### Objectives
This is a website that will compile links to various 4H horse shows to make it easier for the kids and parents to get registered for , find information for, and to find the deadlines for the various horse shows.

I want the comments section to be used by people who come to my website to add new links, comments and info so it becomes a collaborative endeavor.

In the future I would like to add an area loaded with information and tips for people new to the horse show world.
