### Objectives
This is a website that will compile links to various 4H horse shows to make it easier for the kids and parents to get registered for , find information for, and to find the deadlines for the various horse shows.

I want the comments section to be used by people who come to my website to add new links, comments and info so it becomes a collaborative endeavor.

In the future I would like to add an area loaded with information and tips for people new to the horse show world.

As of now, Coveralls is not recognizing any of the tests I've put in with Minitest.  The project is far from fully covered, but it has more than 0% coverage.  I will need to work more on this.
